# NodeJS

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime for server-side programming. It allows developers to create scalable backend functionality using JavaScript, a language many are already familiar with from browser-based web development.

Install `git-flow` by entering the following commands in the terminal:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```

Check that the installation was successful by querying node for its version number:

```shell
node -v
```
